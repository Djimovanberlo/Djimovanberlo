Hello friendly friend! As you might've guessed, my name is Djimo van Berlo and I recently graduated from [Codaisseur Academy](https://codaisseur.com/) as _Junior Full-stack Developer_.  I love creating new things and solving problems in an analytical and creative way. In my free time I like to play with some code, cook up some games and develop some dinner. I like walk around and explore my surroundings, and perhaps the occasional draping-over-the-couch.

Feel free to check out my portfolio website! and have have an absolutely exceptionally exquisitely nice day.
