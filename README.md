Hello friendly friend! As you might've guessed, my name is Djimo van Berlo. I am a medior frontend developer (with some backend sprinkled in!) primarily focussed on React, NextJS and a bunch of styling framewords. I think my favorite is still SASS. I am currently living in Louvain le Neuve while working remotely - and sometimes in real life - in Amsterdam. I love creating new things and solving problems in an analytical and creative way. In my free time I like to play with some code, cook up some games and develop some dinner. I like walk around and explore my surroundings, and perhaps the occasional draping-over-the-couch.

Feel free to check out my [portfolio website](https://djimovanberlo.vercel.app/)! and have have an absolutely exceptionally exquisitely nice day.
